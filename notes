Create a card game environment for RL experiments. Make a 4 player card game in which all 52 cards are initially randomly distributed among 4 players, of which the other 3 players play random cards and the agent's card is passed in as the action. Alternate players are in the same team. In each round, once all players have played their cards, the set goes to the team in which the player played the highest card. Create a dummy function for the reward function to be run at the end of each round.
